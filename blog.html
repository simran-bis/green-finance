                                    First of all, it is important that you get back your capital because Return on
                                    capital is more important than return on capital. This line is very deep if you get
                                    it.

                                    The main reason for picking these stocks is because they are one of the market
                                    leaders in their sector.

                                    Now before continuing I would like to point out that 90% of people on Quora think of
                                    following when they like an answer but forget it as they reach end of the answer
                                    because the follow button is at the top and by this way they actually miss some
                                    valuable content. So if you have not followed follow now!

                                    Options are among the most popular vehicles for traders, because their prices can
                                    move fast, making or losing a lot of money quickly. Options strategies can range
                                    from quite simple to very complex, with a variety of payoffs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Regardless of their complexity, all options strategies are based on the two basic
                                    types of options: the call and the put. Below are a few popular strategies, a
                                    breakdown of their reward and risk, and when a trader might use them. While these
                                    strategies are fairly straightforward, they can make a trader a lot of money, but
                                    they aren’t risk-free.
                                </p>
                                <h4>The Long Put</h4>
                                <p>The long put is an options strategy where the trader buys a put expecting the stock
                                    to be below the strike price before the expiration.</p>
                                <p>When to use: The long put is a useful strategy when you expect the stock to decline
                                    and you want to earn a large upside. Traders will earn a significantly better return
                                    on their investment than by short-selling the stock, so Long Put could be a good
                                    substitute for shorting the stock directly. The long put also limits the short
                                    seller’s loss to the premium, while shorting the stock exposes the trader to
                                    uncapped losses.</p>
                                <p>Risk/Reward: The long put can pay off significantly if the stock moves below the
                                    strike price before the option expires. In general, the maximum value of the long
                                    put equals the total value of the stock underlying the trade. The risk for this
                                    potential upside is a complete loss of the premium paid for the put. But if the
                                    stock moves higher, making the put less valuable, traders often can salvage some of
                                    the value by selling the put, as long as it has substantial time to expiration.</p>

                                    Making mistakes is part of the learning process when it comes to trading. Frequent
                                    trading and shorter holding periods can result in mistakes that can wipe out a new
                                    investor's capital quickly.
                                </p>
                                <p>While most of the investors are guilty of the following mistakes from time to time,
                                    new investors should be very careful about making these mistakes because new
                                    investors might not be able to bounce back from a severe setbacks like experienced
                                    investors.</p>
                                <p>I have invested more than 3 years in the stock market. I have made pretty much all
                                    the mistakes a newcomer can make. I used to trade by myself without any SL or
                                    levels, those mistakes made my positions naked and I had to pay dearly for those
                                    mistakes.</p>
                                <p>I didn’t want to add SL because if my positions keep hitting SL that would spoil my
                                    capital. Another mistake I made was trading daily even though knowing full well that
                                    you can’t make money from the stock market every day. I cannot stress this enough as
                                    I have said this many times in my previous answers as well.</p>
                                <p>After 3 years, I have learned from my mistakes and I can point out a few mistakes
                                    which you should avoid.</p>
