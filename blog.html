                                    First of all, it is important that you get back your capital because Return on capital is more important than return on capital. This line is very deep if you get it. The main reason for picking these stocks is because they are one of the market leaders
                                    in their sector. Now before continuing I would like to point out that 90% of people on Quora think of following when they like an answer but forget it as they reach end of the answer because the follow button is at
                                    the top and by this way they actually miss some valuable content. So if you have not followed follow now!

                                    Options are among the most popular vehicles for traders, because their prices can move fast, making or losing a lot of money quickly. Options strategies can range from quite simple to very complex, with a variety of payoffs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Regardless of their complexity, all options strategies are based on the two basic types of options: the call and the put. Below are a few popular strategies, a breakdown of their reward and risk, and when a trader might use them. While these strategies
                                    are fairly straightforward, they can make a trader a lot of money, but they aren’t risk-free.
                                </p>
                                <h4>The Long Put</h4>
                                <p>The long put is an options strategy where the trader buys a put expecting the stock to be below the strike price before the expiration.</p>
                                <p>When to use: The long put is a useful strategy when you expect the stock to decline and you want to earn a large upside. Traders will earn a significantly better return on their investment than by short-selling the stock,
                                    so Long Put could be a good substitute for shorting the stock directly. The long put also limits the short seller’s loss to the premium, while shorting the stock exposes the trader to uncapped losses.</p>
                                <p>Risk/Reward: The long put can pay off significantly if the stock moves below the strike price before the option expires. In general, the maximum value of the long put equals the total value of the stock underlying the trade.
                                    The risk for this potential upside is a complete loss of the premium paid for the put. But if the stock moves higher, making the put less valuable, traders often can salvage some of the value by selling the put, as
                                    long as it has substantial time to expiration.</p>

                                    Making mistakes is part of the learning process when it comes to trading. Frequent trading and shorter holding periods can result in mistakes that can wipe out a new investor's capital quickly.
                                </p>
                                <p>While most of the investors are guilty of the following mistakes from time to time, new investors should be very careful about making these mistakes because new investors might not be able to bounce back from a severe setbacks
                                    like experienced investors.
                                </p>
                                <p>I have invested more than 3 years in the stock market. I have made pretty much all the mistakes a newcomer can make. I used to trade by myself without any SL or levels, those mistakes made my positions naked and I had to
                                    pay dearly for those mistakes.
                                </p>
                                <p>I didn’t want to add SL because if my positions keep hitting SL that would spoil my capital. Another mistake I made was trading daily even though knowing full well that you can’t make money from the stock market every day.
                                    I cannot stress this enough as I have said this many times in my previous answers as well.</p>
                                <p>After 3 years, I have learned from my mistakes and I can point out a few mistakes which you should avoid.</p>
