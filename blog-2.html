              </h2>

              <div class="entry-content">
                <p>
                  Options are among the most popular vehicles for traders, because their prices can move fast, making or
                  losing a lot of money quickly. Options strategies can range from quite simple to very complex, with a
                  variety of payoffs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Regardless of their complexity, all options strategies are based on the two basic types of options:
                  the call and the put. Below are a few popular strategies, a breakdown of their reward and risk, and
                  when a trader might use them. While these strategies are fairly straightforward, they can make a
                  trader a lot of money, but they aren’t risk-free.
                </p>
                <h4>The Long Put</h4>
                <p>The long put is an options strategy where the trader buys a put expecting the stock to be below the
                  strike price before the expiration.</p>
                <p>When to use: The long put is a useful strategy when you expect the stock to decline and you want to
                  earn a large upside. Traders will earn a significantly better return on their investment than by
                  short-selling the stock, so Long Put could be a good substitute for shorting the stock directly. The
                  long put also limits the short seller’s loss to the premium, while shorting the stock exposes the
                  trader to uncapped losses.</p>
                <p>Risk/Reward: The long put can pay off significantly if the stock moves below the strike price before
                  the option expires. In general, the maximum value of the long put equals the total value of the stock
                  underlying the trade. The risk for this potential upside is a complete loss of the premium paid for
                  the put. But if the stock moves higher, making the put less valuable, traders often can salvage some
                  of the value by selling the put, as long as it has substantial time to expiration.</p>
                <h4>The Long Call</h4>
                <p>With the long call, the trader buys a call expecting the stock to be above the strike price before
                  the expiration.</p>
                <p>When to use: The long call is much like the long put, but it pays out when the stock rises. So if
                  you’re expecting the stock to move higher, the long call is the way to go. The long call can earn a
                  much higher percentage return than owning the stock directly. Because the trader’s downside is limited
                  to the option’s premium, the long call also could be a good strategy if the stock has the potential to
                  move much higher but has the potential to move much lower too. If the stock falls, the option’s
                  limited loss could be less than owning the stock directly.</p>
                <p>Risk/Reward: The long call has an uncapped upside as the stock moves higher, and that’s why this
                  strategy can be a home run. If a stock rises, you can make many times your investment. Like the long
                  put, the risk here is that the investor could lose all of the premium paid for the call. However, if
                  the stock moves lower making the call less valuable traders often can save some of the value by
                  selling the call, as long as it has substantial time remaining to expiration.</p>
                <h4>The Short Put</h4>
                <p>In a short put, the trader sells a put expecting the stock to be higher than the strike price by
                  expiration. This is similar to selling insurance against the stock falling below the strike price.</p>
                <p>When to use: There are two good situations for the short put. If the trader expects the stock to be
                  above the strike price at expiration, the short put is a way to generate income by pocketing the
                  premium. The trader can use the short put to achieve a more attractive buy price on the underlying
                  stock. If the stock doesn’t move below the strike price, the trader keeps the premium and can execute
                  the strategy again. If the stock falls below the strike, the trader buys the stock at a discount to
                  the strike price, using the premium to reduce the net price paid.</p>
                <p>Risk/Reward: The short put’s maximum payoff is the premium received by the trader. The stock might
                  fall well below the strike price, but all the short put earns is the premium. The maximum payoff
                  occurs anywhere above the strike price.</p>
                <h4>The Covered Call</h4>
                <p>To create a covered call, the trader sells call options for every 100 shares of the underlying stock
                  owned. The investor expects the stock to remain relatively flat, allowing the call to expire
                  worthlessly. This allows the trader to pocket the premium without having to sell the stock at the
                  strike price.</p>
                <p>
                  When to use: The covered call can be an effective strategy for generating income when the investor
                  owns the stock and expects it to remain relatively flat over the life of the option. The covered call
                  also can be an “exit strategy” for a position, with the investor selling calls for a strike price that
                  they would be willing to receive and getting to pocket the extra premium.
                </p>
                <p>Risk/Reward: The covered call’s maximum payoff is the premium received. This occurs right at the
                  strike price, allowing the option seller to keep the premium without having to sell the underlying
                  stock or losing any money on it.</p>
                <h4>The Married Put</h4>
                <p>When using a married put, the trader buys put options on stock for every 100 shares of the underlying
                  stock owned. The investor suspects the stock may fall in the short term but wants to continue owning
                  it because it may rise significantly. So the married put protects the investor’s downside.</p>
                <p>
                  When to use: There are two scenarios where the married put works well.
                <ul>
                  <li>The investor expects the stock could move in either direction in the short term but wants to own
                    it for the long term. So the put allows the investor to profit from the expected temporary fall in
                    the stock. The investor may not want to sell the stock for some other reason, and the married put
                    allows the investor to profit from the decline without having to sell the stock.</li>
                  <li>
                    Risk/Reward: The married put’s maximum total profit is unlimited if the stock moves higher. The
                    whole point of the married put is to allow the investor to gain the potential upside by paying for
                    “insurance”. If the stock moves lower, then the put increases in value to offset that loss. The
                    maximum downside is the lost premium. The married put is a hedged position, and the investor expects
                    to lose money on one end of the hedge. The trader pays the option’s premium, and if that’s the
                    maximum loss, then it’s a good thing.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>The Long Straddle</h4>
                <p>The long straddle is a strategy where the trader buys an at-the-money call and an at-the-money put
                  with the same expiration and the same strike price. The trader suspects the stock may move
                  significantly but is not sure in which direction.</p>
                <p>When to use: The long straddle is a strategy that’s useful when you expect the stock to be volatile
                  but it’s difficult to determine which direction it’s going. A long straddle costs a lot to set up and
                  requires a big move to profit.</p>
                <p>Risk/Reward: The long straddle can return a lot, and theoretically the return is uncapped if the
                  stock soars. However, any profit will have to deduct the substantial cost to set up the trade, and
                  this trade requires a stock to move big to make it profitable. The downside of the long straddle is
                  the complete</p>
                <p>loss of the premiums paid if the stock doesn’t move. However, if the stock moves even a little bit in
                  either direction, the trader usually can recover some of the premia if there’s enough time until
                  expiration on the options.</p>
                <h4>The Long Strangle</h4>
                <p>The long strangle is like the long straddle, but it’s cheaper to set up because it uses
                  out-of-the-money options instead of at-the-money options. In the long strangle, an investor buys a
                  call and a put option at prices above and below the current stock price, respectively. The trade-off,
                  relative to the straddle, is that the stock must move even more for the strategy to work.</p>
                <p>When to use: The long strangle is used when you expect the stock to move even more than you would
                  when using a long straddle. So if you expect a big move in the stock, the long strangle can be cheaper
                  to set up and deliver a higher percentage return than the straddle.</p>
                <p>Risk/reward: Like the long straddle, the long strangle can return a high percentage, theoretically
                  uncapped if the stock rises. Similarly, it’s also a wager that the stock will move significantly in
                  either direction, without the investor having a clear sense of which way. The main advantage of the
                  strangle over the straddle is that it requires less money to set up. The maximum downside of the long
                  strangle is the complete loss of the premiums paid if the stock fails to move much. Because the
                  options were purchased out of the money, it takes a more significant move to recapture some of the
                  premium, though it is possible if time remains on the options.</p>
