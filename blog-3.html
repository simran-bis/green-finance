                                    Making mistakes is part of the learning process when it comes to trading. Frequent trading and shorter holding periods can result in mistakes that can wipe out a new investor's capital quickly.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    While most of the investors are guilty of the following mistakes from time to time, new investors should be very careful about making these mistakes because new investors might not be able to bounce back from a severe setbacks like experienced investors.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I have invested more than 3 years in the stock market. I have made pretty much all the mistakes a newcomer can make. I used to trade by myself without any SL or levels, those mistakes made my positions naked and I had to pay dearly for those mistakes.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    I didn’t want to add SL because if my positions keep hitting SL that would spoil my capital. Another mistake I made was trading daily even though knowing full well that you can’t make money from the stock market every day. I cannot stress this enough
                                    as I have said this many times in my previous answers as well.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    After 3 years, I have learned from my mistakes and I can point out a few mistakes which you should avoid.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Be strict with your stop loss: It means when you are losing money, cut your losses, and get out of the market. Similarly, if you are on a winning spree, setting a proper stop loss will protect your profits when the stock markets start going down.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Learn whenever you suffer a loss: We lose money in the market due to our mistakes. Find out where you went wrong and ensure you don't repeat it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Avoid greed: It is easy to put money in a dud stock just because it is going up. But remember this price rise is due to market manipulation rather than any genuine change in the company's financial situation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Avoid leveraging: Many people borrow heavily from others to maximize their profits. Though this may work in certain instances, it can also cause massive losses if the market cycle turns. This can lead to financial as well as mental stress and can lead
                                    to the destruction of family lives as well as suicides in certain instances.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Don't act if you are not sure which way the stock markets will move: In such instances, it is better to be a passive onlooker instead of participating in the market action.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Read a lot: There are many good books on investing available on the subject. Always keep on updating your knowledge. Also follow thoughts and opinions given by respected investors like Warren Buffet, Rakesh Jhunjhunwala, etc. It will expand your knowledge
                                    and help you tackle any market situation comfortably
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Limit the number of stocks: Ensure your holding comprises not more than 20 stocks. Also, ensure these stocks are from companies operating in different sectors to protect your portfolio from losing its value.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Don't use various investment strategies: If you are comfortable with the buy and hold strategy, use the same one for all your stocks. Otherwise, you might be confused about which strategy helps you make money.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Remain patient and disciplined, whatever the market condition: If the markets are crashing don't get out of the market, but wait for the market to go up. Also don't continue to invest in the stock, simply because it is going up.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Choose stocks as per your risk profile instead of the returns they generate: If you are not comfortable with the high volatility of the small and mid-caps, don't invest in them simply because they offer high returns.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    These are the points you must keep in mind when investing to avoid mistakes that I made. If you have good capital then I recommend you avoid trading only Intraday, as it is the riskiest segment of the market. The only intraday can spoil your capital.
                                    I encourage you to invest in BTST/STBT or Positional trades as well if you are looking for long term wealth depending upon market conditions.
                                </p>
